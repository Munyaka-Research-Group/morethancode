Current version of the website can be seen here: https://wishingwell13.github.io/morethancode/

To run via command line: `http-server . -p 3000`

Make sure to update `sw.js`'s cache number each time you push, to let service workers know to update the website.

Tests are written using Jest and Puppeteer.

`toggle.html` is a copy of `index.html` that contains the progress toggle, and should be updated to match `index.html` if `index.html` is edited. Otherwise, delete it.

A tutorial of setting up the repo using SourceTree can be found in [/assets/dev-tutorials](/assets/dev-tutorials/Sourcetree-Tutorial.mp4)
